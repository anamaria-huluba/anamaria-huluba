## Hello, I'm Anamaria! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

### Nice to see you here! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=${anamaria-huluba}.${your.repo.id})

I am a **ultralearner** with six months experience dedicated to building my abilities in Tech, gauging all my efforts towards a career switch. Found an amazingly supportive community on LinkedIn, and have constantly worked on preparing a smooth transition.

I'm currently undertaking a Data Engineer Bootcamp with [TechUp](https://techupwomen.org/). which is an exciting new [Institute of Coding](https://instituteofcoding.org/) funded programme that retrains individuals into technology careers.

I follow a holistic approach in all areas of my life and my hobbies also reflect this. Reading (I'm following Christina Stathopoulo’s [#bookaweekchallenge](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23bookaweekchallenge&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=ada)), taking long walks to admire nature's beauty, meditating, cooking simple but healthy recipes and kickboxing all are waved into my daily life and building upon each other.   

Additionally, I feel very passionately about raising awareness on subjects that are close to my heart and trying to spread some love with my [#kindnessmovement ❤️](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23kindnessmovement&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=BE6).

Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anamaria-huluba/) so we can learn together!
